# fhw-phone-tracker

Allows tracking of positions if at the [University of Applied Sciences Wedel](http://www.fh-wedel.de). Uses WiFi APs of known location and currently requires a custom server side script to be installed. If you want to see it in action visit the [homepage of Marcus Riemer](http://www.fh-wedel.de/mitarbeiter/mri). This project was started by [Hermann HÃ¶hne](http://www.hehoe.de/) who is currently writing his Master Thesis in the same office as Marcus and was annoyed that he couldn't thourougly answer "where is Marcus?" questions.
